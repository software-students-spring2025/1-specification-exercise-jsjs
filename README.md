## Ideation

* We want to create a marketplace to trade "stocks" based on the performance of runners. The problem with current betting sites is that most bets only last for the duration of a game/match. Those who want to make more long term bets and follow specific athletes can now do so with our platform. 
* Our target end users are those who are active participants in the the running community- especially the D3 running community. We want to target people who are passionate about running and follow both the collegiate and professional landscape closely. We feel that these type of people are most likely participate in our market and be the most active participants. 

## Stakeholders

* Stakeholder 1 (Nikhil): 
    * Goals/Needs
        * Wants a platform that allows him to bet on sports outside of the major sports (football, soccer, baseball, etc.)
        * Wants long "bets" that allow him to follow an athlete for longer than a single game/match
    * Problems/Frustrations
        * He is frustrated that there is a lack of data/information on betting apps
        * No centralized location to track overall profits/losses
        * Frustrated with how big of a cut some sports book take from his winnings

* Stakeholder 2 (Tyler):
    * Goals/Needs
        * Wants to take advantage of his running knowledge to make money
        * Needs a mobile version so that he can access and make trades anywhere he wants
        * Needs payment security to feel comfortable with putting in and taking out money from the app
    * Problems/Frustrations
        * Some betting apps feel like a scam and he is deterred from making bets/trades
        * No real time data is frustrating for Tyler as he cannot make quick decisions to make the necessary trades 

## Product Vision Statement

Our platform aims to create, lead, disrupt, and revolutionize the Division III track and field betting experience by providing an intuitive, data-driven marketplace where users can discover, invest in, and trade bets on emerging athletes. By empowering users with real-time insights, transparent odds, and community-driven engagement, LacTic aims to provide a dynamic and fair market for all participants to bring the sports-betting industry to new realms.


## User Requirements

Given our established product vision, mingled with our user interviews and identified pain points from our Stakeholder interviews, we established 10 user requirements we aim to acknowldege in our wireframe and clickable prototype:

* As a track and field investor, I want to filter runners based on performance stats (e.g., times, recent wins) so that I can make informed betting decisions.

* As a track and field investor, I want to see a list of upcoming D3 races and bet on them so that I can engage with the sport in a new way.

* As a track and field investor, I want a central dashboard where I can easily navigate to my portfolio, the market, race schedules, and trade history so that I can efficiently manage my investments and track athlete performances.

* As a track and field investor, I want to place long-term bets on athletes so that I can follow their progress beyond just a single race.

* As a track and field investor, I want to watch live race results and updates so that I can follow my bets in real-time.

* As a track and field investor, I want to buy and sell bets dynamically based on athlete performance so that I can capitalize on market trends.

* As a track and field investor, I want a history of all my transactions so that I can track my financial activity.

* As a track and field investor, I want a trustworthy and transparent betting system so that I feel confident in the platformâ€™s fairness.

* As a track and field investor, I want to filter athletes by school, year, and price so that I can easily find and evaluate runners that match my investment strategy.

* As a track and field investor, I want the process of making trades (Buy/Sell) easy and fast so that I can spend most of my time researching and reading about athletes to maximize my returns.
